/*
* Hello Farida
* you may self destruct these comments when you have completed the challenge ðŸ•¹
*
* You have a greater grasp JS... SOOO now to take things to next level, lets talk Design Patterns.
* Which we will cover more in next semester, but as i always say "there is no time like the present" so here we go
*
* I want you to think of you code as modules and in also in a functional way. think of all the different peices of code you have and break them down into single purpose functions(where possible).
*
* Design Pattern 1
* The revealing module pattern
*
* the basic idea is you can with having to use import statements or module or requires (because they are not yet fully supported in ALL browsers yet),
* you can have code that is broken down into modules
* break up you code modules, these modules can be single purpose functions, functions that you will be able to call from any where in your app
**
* an example I made with psuedocode: https://github.com/mannuelf/js-scratch-pad/tree/master/src/revealing-module-pattern
* some light reading: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
